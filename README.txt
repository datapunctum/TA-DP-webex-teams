## Introduction

The purpose of this add-on is to collect Webex Teams Events and Webex Teams Audit-Events through the [Webex Teams API](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/getting-started)

This Add-on has been built using the Splunk Add-on Builder

## Special Features

* If files have been uploaded in a message, the event can be enriched with file information.
* If rooms have been created, the event can be enriched with the room title.
* Messages can be masked for privacy

## Authentication

Authentication to the API is through Personal Access Tokens. An Personal Access Token can be acquired through a Refresh Token, which has to be renewed once a while.

The Add-on expects an active Refresh Tokens and keeps track of the lifetime of the Access Token and automatically refreshes the access token if needed.

Additionally to the Refresh Token, the Client ID and Client Secret has to be provided.

Multiple Refresh Tokens with different access rights.(up to 4) may be configured and referenced by Inputs.
